# Direct Linux package from ookla-speedtest

This is a package I downloaded from https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli

# What It Does

- Measure internet connection performance metrics like download, upload, latency and packet loss natively without relying on a web browser
- Test the internet connection of your Linux desktop, a remote server or even lower-powered devices such as the Raspberry Pi® with the Speedtest Server Network™
- Set up automated scripts to collect connection performance data, including trends over time
- Output structured data ready for integration with visualization dashboards and observability platforms
- Use Speedtest in your programs by wrapping it in the programming language of your choice
- View test results via CSV, JSONL or JSON

# How to use

1) Open terminal in the directory where you have the 'speedtest' file

2) Type the following (needs root privileges, not sure)
	```
	sudo <package manager> ./speedtest
	```
